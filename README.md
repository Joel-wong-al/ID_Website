3. Errors & Handling

Errors That We Have Faced

Menu button does not work on Mystery Box page and Home page



Issue: The menu button was unresponsive on both the Mystery Box and Home pages.

Fix: The issue was resolved by removing the existing code and then copying and pasting the menu button code from another working page.

Bottom navigation bar blocking images and content



Issue: On the Products page, the bottom navigation bar was overlapping product images, and on the Account page, it was blocking the input fields.

Fix: Added padding to the body to separate the content from the navigation bar.

Menu design not showing up on the Product page



Issue: The menu styling was missing or not applying correctly when the menu button was clicked on the Product page.

Fix: Verified that the CSS and JavaScript for the menu were linked properly and ensured that styles were being correctly applied.

Product images not loading



Issue: Some product images were not displaying because the image file paths were incorrect or the images were missing from the directory.

Fix: Checked and corrected the file paths in the products.json file and ensured all images were uploaded to the correct directory.

Cart not updating after adding items



Issue: Clicking "Add to Cart" did not update the shopping cart properly.

Fix: Debugged the JavaScript responsible for updating the cart state and ensured that the correct cart array was being modified and stored in local storage.

Responsive issues on mobile devices



Issue: Some elements (such as text, images, or buttons) were overflowing the screen or breaking layout on smaller devices.

Fix: Adjusted CSS flexbox/grid properties and added media queries to ensure the website adapted to smaller screen sizes.

Checkout page form validation errors



Issue: The checkout page allowed form submission even when required fields (e.g., address, phone number) were empty.

Fix: Implemented JavaScript validation to prevent submission until all required fields were correctly filled.

Broken links in the menu



Issue: Some navigation links were not working because they were pointing to incorrect file paths.

Fix: Verified and corrected all page links in the HTML files to ensure they directed users to the correct pages.
